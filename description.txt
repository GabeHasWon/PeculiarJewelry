Peculiar Jewelry adds a ton of jewelry, which allow you to set in jewels. Each jewel has its own benefits, and can be upgraded for even more benefits.
Furthermore, jewelry has material benefits (such as increased life regeneration bonuses) - so there's a ton more to mix and match.

Alongside this, there's a system which allows you to gamble - fight significantly harder bosses for more powerful jewels? It's up to you.
A mysterious and well dressed man called the Lapidarist will help you get through it.
