- Fixed Set Jewels UI saying "(No jewel inserted)" instead of "(No jewelry inserted)"
- Fixed Keepsake Chest not functioning
- Changed the "Stronger traps and stronger debuffs" to "Stronger traps and debuffs"
- Added tooltip to Keepsake Chest
- Fixed Pauldrons displaying set jewels incorrectly
- Added help screens to all remaining UI
	These should help clarify all functionality, especially for Superimposition.
